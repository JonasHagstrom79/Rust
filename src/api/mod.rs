// src/api/mod.rs

// This file serves as the module file for the `api` module in the library. The purpose of this file is to declare submodules
// within the `api` module, effectively organizing the code related to the API functionality of the library into a clear structure.
// By declaring submodules here, we are able to separate concerns and functionalities into different files or directories,
// making the codebase more manageable and logically organized.

// The `pub mod handlers;` line declares a public submodule named `handlers`. This submodule is expected to contain the logic
// for handling different types of requests that the API might receive. For example, it could include functions to add, delete,
// or modify data. The `handlers` module can be defined in a file named `handlers.rs` in the same directory as this `mod.rs` file,
// or in a directory named `handlers` with its own `mod.rs` file. Making it public allows other parts of the library, or even
// external crates, to use the functionalities defined within `handlers`.

// Similarly, the `pub mod routers;` line declares another public submodule named `routers`. This submodule is responsible for
// defining the routes that map URLs to their corresponding handler functions. It essentially acts as a dispatcher, directing
// incoming requests to the appropriate parts of the codebase for processing. Like `handlers`, `routers` can be defined in a
// `routers.rs` file or a `routers` directory with a `mod.rs` file. It being public means that its functionalities are accessible
// from outside the `api` module, allowing for integration with other parts of the library or external crates.

// src/lib.rs

// This line declares a public module named `api`. The `pub` keyword makes this module accessible from outside of this library,
// allowing other parts of the project, or even other projects that depend on this library, to use the `api` module.
// The `api` module is expected to be defined either in a file named `api.rs` in the same directory as this `lib.rs` file,
// or in a directory named `api` with a `mod.rs` file inside it. This module can contain definitions for functions, structs, enums,
// and other modules, which are meant to be part of the public API of this library.
